# Git test for the ADA homework

## Code comes from: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_assumptions.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-kmeans-assumptions-py

This example is meant to illustrate situations where k-means will produce unintuitive and possibly unexpected clusters. In the first three plots, the input data does not conform to some implicit assumption that k-means makes and undesirable clusters are produced as a result. In the last plot, k-means returns intuitive clusters despite unevenly sized blobs.
